# Sorting Algorithms Project

This project contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in multiple programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Java. Each algorithm is organized into its own folder, with separate subfolders for each programming language.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Bubble Sort**
   - A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   - Implementations:
     - Python: `bubble_sort/python/BubbleSort.py`
     - JavaScript: `bubble_sort/javascript/BubbleSort.js`
     - Java: `bubble_sort/java/BubbleSort.java`

2. **Insertion Sort**
   - A sorting algorithm that builds a sorted array one element at a time by comparing and inserting elements in their correct position.
   - Implementations:
     - Python: `insertion_sort/python/InsertionSort.py`
     - JavaScript: `insertion_sort/javascript/InsertionSort.js`
     - Java: `insertion_sort/java/InsertionSort.java`

3. **Selection Sort**
   - A sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the sorted portion.
   - Implementations:
     - Python: `selection_sort/python/SelectionSort.py`
     - JavaScript: `selection_sort/javascript/SelectionSort.js`
     - Java: `selection_sort/java/SelectionSort.java`

4. **Merge Sort**
   - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by dividing it into halves, sorting each half, and merging them back together.
   - Implementations:
     - Python: `merge_sort/python/MergeSort.py`
     - JavaScript: `merge_sort/javascript/MergeSort.js`
     - Java: `merge_sort/java/MergeSort.java`

5. **Quick Sort**
   - A highly efficient sorting algorithm that sorts an array by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays.
   - Implementations:
     - Python: `quick_sort/python/QuickSort.py`
     - JavaScript: `quick_sort/javascript/QuickSort.js`
     - Java: `quick_sort/java/QuickSort.java`

## How to Run

To run the sorting algorithms, navigate to the respective language folder and execute the corresponding file. Ensure you have the necessary environment set up for the programming language you are using.

- For Python, use:
  ```
  python BubbleSort.py
  ```

- For JavaScript, use:
  ```
  node BubbleSort.js
  ```

- For Java, compile and run:
  ```
  javac BubbleSort.java
  java BubbleSort
  ```

Feel free to explore each implementation and modify them as needed for your learning or project requirements!
