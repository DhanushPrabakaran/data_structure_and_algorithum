# Bubble Sort Algorithm

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

## ðŸ§  How Bubble Sort Works

1. Compare the first two elements.
2. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair and repeat step 2.
4. Continue until the end of the array.
5. Repeat the entire process for `n-1` passes (where `n` is the array length) or until no swaps are needed.
